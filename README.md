# Diabetic-Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can lead to vision loss and blindness in diabetics. It has an effect on the blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye).

If you have diabetes, you should have a thorough dilated eye exam at least once a year. Diabetic retinopathy may not present any symptoms at first, but detecting it early can help you protect your vision.

The following project focuses on detection of diabetic retinopathy(whether a person has diabetes or not on the basis of retinal scans). The model used here is the VGG16 model with an accuracy of 91%.
